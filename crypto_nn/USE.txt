To build crypto_nn, you will need to have HElib, GMP and NTL libraries installed.
Now that you have these libraries, you have to copy header files from Helib/src
directory to crypto_nn/include and fhe.a to crypto_nn/lib.

On the command line in the crypto_nn directory:

   make

will compile and build bin/crypto_nn.
